## Research

Despite not having ClickUp amongst the provided options in the task, I still decided to use it due to the following facts:
- It was mentioned equally amongst the biased ratings of other task tracker software sites, like [Teamhub](https://teamhub.com/blog/best-project-management-tools-for-game-developers/), [Placky](https://plaky.com/blog/game-project-management/), [Codecks](https://www.codecks.io/blog/project-management-tools-in-game-development/), and sites, that look more or less indepedndent, like [Onethread](https://www.codecks.io/blog/project-management-tools-in-game-development/) also mention it. All of them underline ClickUp's ability to view taks both as Kanban board or as a task list, as well as the overall high level of customisation - custom fields, colorful themes, etc.
- Me personally like it more than any other alternative (which is a little bit subjective), and I had experience with Trello, You Track and Jira in both professional and personal organisation routine. ClickUp provides the capabilities of in-place time tracking (for instance, I am tracking me doing the development journal now in ClickUp) which I find very convinient. It is connected to my phone app so I can check updates on my tasks and plan the day on the go. I am quite sure that no else students gonna use it. Plus, it provides the ability to embed tasks and lists, like this:
<iframe class="clickup-embed" src="https://sharing.clickup.com/9015630444/t/h/86c0ebvxh/0B4VGPT0LRI6UW0" onwheel="" width="100%" height="700px" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
```

Let's break down how I did spread the tasks across the week:
### Week 1
Me - taking the Core Gameplay task. Core gameplay is one

### What would you do differently next time?

# General Tips

- Use plenty of images and videos to demonstrate your point. You can embed YouTube tutorials, your own recordings, etc.
- Always reference! Even documentation, tutorials and anything you used for your assignment. Use an inline reference for the sentence and a bibliography reference at the end.
- Word count is not important, you can also chose to use bullet points. As long as it is clear and readable, the format your decide to use can be flexible.
- You are free to use AI but please ensure you have made a note in the declared assets, for example if you have a script called Test.cs , you should note that AI was used to in the creation of this script. You can use a bullet point list for each asset used like:

The following assets were created or modified with the use of GPT 4o:
- Test.cs
- AnotherScript.cs
- Development Journal.html
